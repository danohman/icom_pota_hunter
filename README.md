# icom_pota_hunter
Icom POTA (Parks on the Air) Hunter

Python script to fetch spots from Parks on the Air and tune your ICOM radio to the spot frequency

Requirements:
  pytz
  pyperclip
  PySimpleGUI

The Icom radio's CIV COM Port, Baud rate, and Address are hard coded into the script along with the path to the Image file.

Change these!

Please fork this and make it better! I am a horrendous python coder so excuse my messy crap.
